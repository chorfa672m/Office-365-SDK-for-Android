The test app uses Cookies authentication and can run against any SharePoint site located at .sharepoint.com.

In order to run the test you will need to create (or have an existing) list and the same goes for a picture library. This is mandatory since we don't have a way of creating picture libraries or lists.

For example, in your SharePoint site please create a picture library named : "TestPicLib"  and a list named : "TestList".

Depending which set of test you want to run (files or tests) you will need to update the test lib name under settings.

Once you have everything configured, simple select which set of tests one to run (depending the name of the listname you have in the configuration), select the tests and run them. 

Please, erase the cookies before running the test app. When you run the test for first time, it will ask for your credentials.
