Office 365 SDK for Android Preview
==========================

Overview

It’s now possible to use data stored in Microsoft Office 365 from your Android Apps. You can access SharePoint lists, folders or Exchange calendar, contacts and emails from within your Android applications. 

Microsoft Open Technologies, Inc. (MS Open Tech) has built the Office 365 SDK for Android Preview, an open source project that strives to help Android developers access Office 365 data from their apps. This SDK provides access to:  
•	Microsoft SharePoint Lists 
•	Microsoft SharePoint Files
•	Microsoft Exchange Calendar
•	Microsoft Exchange Contacts
•	Microsoft Exchange Mail

Best of all, it’s FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) so that you can participate in the development process as we build these libraries.
