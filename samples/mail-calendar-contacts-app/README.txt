Working with Maven:
-------------------

	Prerequisites:
	--------------
	
	- Maven 3.1.1
	- Android SDK (Platform v19 downloaded)
	- ADAL artifact in your local Maven repository 
		- Download here: https://github.com/MSOpenTech/azure-activedirectory-library-for-android
		- Install with: >> mvn clean install
	
	Usage:
	------

	Here is a list of folders and files that are either required or generated by Maven to make project work:

	Name:					Status:
	-----------------------------------
	demo-app\
		res\					- REQUIRED
		src\					- REQUIRED
		target\					- generated
		AndroidManifest.xml		- REQUIRED
		pom.xml					- REQUIRED	
	demo-deployer\				- REQUIRED (this project will convert and install all Android SDK dependencies into your local repo so you don't have to worry about it)
	pom.xml						- REQUIRED

	To create .apk file	execute:
	
	>> mvn clean package OR >> mvn clean install

	To deploy application on connected device or emulator execute:
	
	>> mvn android:deploy


Working in Eclipse:
-------------------

	1. With Maven

		Prerequisites:
		--------------
		
		- Maven 3.1.1
		- Android SDK (Platform v19 downloaded)
		
		Usage:
		------

		Project files can be generated with:

		>> mvn eclipse:clean eclipse:eclipse 

		As result each Maven module will get a consistent .project, .classpath and .settings file with which each module can be imported as existing project to Eclipse. 

	2. Without Maven

		Prerequisites:
		--------------
		
		- Eclipse Indigo or Kepler
		- Android SDK (Platform v19 downloaded)
		- Download Otto library, put it in the 'libs' folder and add to build path. Download: http://square.github.io/otto/
		- Add android-support-v4 library to the 'libs' folder and add to build path. You can take it from Android SDK: "<SDK-root>/extras/android/support/v4/"
		
		
		Usage:
		------

		Here is a list of folders and files that are either required or generated by Eclipse to make project work:

		Name:					Status:
		-----------------------------------
		adal\						- REQUIRED
		appcompat\					- REQUIRED (You can also change project.settings and link to another location with this library if you have it)
		demo-app\		
			.settings\ 				- generated
			bin\					- generated
			gen\					- generated
			libs\					- REQUIRED
			res\					- REQUIRED
			src\					- REQUIRED
			.classpath				- REQUIRED (you can also edit Build Path from Eclipse if you miss this file)
			.project				- REQUIRED (you need this to make Eclipse recognise it as a project. However you might want to import project as Android Sources. I the latter case you won't need this file)
			AndroidManifest.xml		- REQUIRED
			project.properties		- REQUIRED
